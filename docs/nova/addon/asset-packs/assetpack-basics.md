# AssetPack

An AssetPack is a collection of all assets needed by your addon. It's pretty much just your addon's resource pack. However,
the format differs a lot from a vanilla resource pack. To start of create a ``assets`` directory in your addon's resources
folder.

Now create a ``materials.json`` file in that folder. Adding materials will be explained in the next section.
