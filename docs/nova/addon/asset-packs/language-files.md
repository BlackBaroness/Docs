# Language files

Everything in Nova has to be localized which is why language files are very important. To start off, create a folder called
``lang`` in your ``assets`` root folder. Here you can create language files for your addon. The format for these files is
the same the one minecraft uses. If you need the locale code for a language, you can search for it [here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language).

!!! warning

    **Make sure to use the "in-game" locale code since ISO-639-3 is not yet implemented by Minecraft**
