# Migration Guide 0.13 ‚ûù 0.14

This release is mainly just the update to 1.20, but there are a few changes that you should be aware of.

## Removed `spigotResourceId` from the addon description and the related gradle task

Instead, you can now set a list of `ProjectDistributors` in code, which will be used to check for updates:

```kotlin title="MyAddon.kt"
object MyAddon : Addon() {
    
    override val projectDistributors = listOf(
        ProjectDistributor.hangar(/*project id*/),
        ProjectDistributor.spigotmc(/*project id*/),
        ProjectDistributor.modrinth(/*project id*/),
        ProjectDistributor.github(/*project id*/)
    )

}
```

## Changed `NovaRecipe.key: NamspacedKey` to `NovaRecipe.id: ResourceLocation`

In the effort to convert everything from `NamespacedId` / `NamespacedKey` to `ResourceLocation`, the `NovaRecipe`
class has now also been updated to use `ResourceLocation`. If you've created a custom recipe deserializer, you'll probably
now also need to switch to `RecipeDeserializer#getRecipeId(File)`.

## Smithing Recipes

Since Mojang has changed smithing, the `SMITHING_TRANSFORM` and recipe files now also need to be in a `smithing_transform`
directory. You'll also now need to specify a `template` ingredient.  
There is currently no support for smithing trim recipes.
