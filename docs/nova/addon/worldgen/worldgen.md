# World Generation Overview

!!! warning

    Custom World Generation **needs** a java agent to work. Minecraft's world gen format is deeply nested via [DataFixerUpper](https://github.com/Mojang/DataFixerUpper)
    and it's not possible to call Nova's block placement code without modifying the servers code. So make sure your JVM supports
    java agents and that the `use_agent` option is set to `true` in Nova's `config.yml` file.

Nova's worldgen is completely based on [Minecraft's custom worldgen format](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Custom_world_generation) with
some additions. Below you'll find a quick overview of the format and how to use it. Check the sidebar for more detailed information.
